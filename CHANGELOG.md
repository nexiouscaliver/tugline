# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Daemon flush path: a healthy ntfy reply stream never ended on its own
  (keepalive events every 45s reset the read timeout), so the serve loop
  never returned to flush and every record queued after daemon start sat
  undelivered. Each stream pass is now bounded by a flush interval
  (default 5s, deadline checked per line), so the spool flushes at least
  every 10 seconds even while the stream is held open.

### Added

- One `flush pass: scanned/handled/published/marked/suppressed` summary
  log line per flush pass (empty passes included), so an idle or starved
  flush is visible in the daemon log instead of silent.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- Repository skeleton: MIT license, uv-based packaging with hatchling, src
  layout, CI on Python 3.10 and 3.14, release workflow using PyPI Trusted
  Publishing.
- Core library: payload normalization for hook input, TOML config with
  loud validation of every key, append-only spool with delivery marks,
  arming and idle-threshold policy, one-shot ntfy publisher with a bearer
  token file, daemon, CLI.
- Daemon publishing and replies: retry with capped exponential backoff;
  a held streaming subscribe on the reply topic appends each phone reply
  to `~/.tugline/replies.jsonl` and resumes from a saved cursor after a
  disconnect.
- `tug` CLI: `notify`, `arm`, `disarm`, `test`, `status`, `daemon`
  (with `--once`), `version`, and the adapter entries `hook-zcode`,
  `install zcode`, `uninstall zcode`, `hook-claude`.
- zcode adapter: hook entry, byte-preserving installer and uninstaller for
  `~/.zcode/cli/config.json`, and a bounded fail-closed approve flow behind
  the approve toggle (off by default).
- Claude Code adapter: hook entry, append-only installer and uninstaller
  for `~/.claude/settings.json`, and a bounded fail-closed approve flow
  behind the approve toggle (off by default).
- Approve receiver: loopback HTTP listener (`approve_port`) that records
  Approve/Deny button presses as decisions; `external_url` points the
  buttons at a host that proxies `/approvals` back to this machine.
- Documentation set: README, quickstart, channels playbook, adapter
  guides, Codex and Aider recipes, always-on hosting sketch, comparison
  table, security policy, contributing guide.

## [0.0.1]

- Repository skeleton: MIT license, uv-based packaging with hatchling, src
  layout; `tug` CLI entry point with `--version` and a `hello` smoke
  command; GitHub Actions CI with uv on a Python 3.10 and 3.14 matrix;
  release workflow for PyPI Trusted Publishing on `v*` tags.
