## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- Repository skeleton: MIT license, uv-based packaging with hatchling, src
  layout, CI on Python 3.10 and 3.14, release workflow using PyPI Trusted
  Publishing.
- Core library: payload normalization for hook input, TOML config with
  loud validation of every key, append-only spool with delivery marks,
  arming and idle-threshold policy, one-shot ntfy publisher with a bearer
  token file, daemon, CLI.
- Daemon publishing and replies: retry with capped exponential backoff;
  a held streaming subscribe on the reply topic appends each phone reply
  to `~/.tugline/replies.jsonl` and resumes from a saved cursor after a
  disconnect.
- `tug` CLI: `notify`, `arm`, `disarm`, `test`, `status`, `daemon`
  (with `--once`), `version`, and the adapter entries `hook-zcode`,
  `install zcode`, `uninstall zcode`, and the other adapter's hook
  entry.
- zcode adapter: hook entry, byte-preserving installer and uninstaller for
  `~/.zcode/cli/config.json`, and a bounded fail-closed approve flow behind
  the approve toggle (off by default).
- Claude Code adapter: hook entry, append-only installer and uninstaller
  for the harness settings file, and a bounded fail-closed approve flow
  behind the approve toggle (off by default).
- Approve receiver: loopback HTTP listener (`approve_port`) that records
  Approve/Deny button presses as decisions; `external_url` points the
  buttons at a host that proxies `/approvals` back to this machine.
- Documentation set: README, quickstart, channels playbook, adapter
  guides, Codex and Aider recipes, always-on hosting sketch, comparison
  table, security policy, contributing guide.

## [0.0.1]

- Repository skeleton: MIT license, uv-based packaging with hatchling, src
  layout; `tug` CLI entry point with `--version` and a `hello` smoke
  command; GitHub Actions CI with uv on a Python 3.10 and 3.14 matrix;
  release workflow for PyPI Trusted Publishing on `v*` tags.
